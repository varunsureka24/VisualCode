    <p>
        The mountain chicken used to be located on 
        many of the smaller islands in the Caribbean Sea, 
        but now it solely lives in Dominica and Montserrat. 
        Even now the population of the mountain chicken is 
        declining. Various volcanic activity on Montserrat 
        has restricted their habitat solely to Centre Hill 
        in northern Montserrat. Its habitat consists of moist, 
        dense forests and scrubs, river valleys, and flooded forests. 
        It is most commonly found near water and generally around 
        lower altitudes.
