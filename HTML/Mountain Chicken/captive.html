        However, all hope isnâ€™t lost yet. Dedicated conservation 
        measures have been established to control the population. 
        These measures include raising awareness, raising funds, 
        and breeding frogs in captivity.
        Captive-bred frogs provide a saftey-net should the 
        population decline further in the native habitats. Slowly, these frogs 
        are being reintroduced into Montserrat in a trial program 
        to determine the success of reintroduction. There is hope 
        that the mountain chicken can return to the prevalence that 
        it once had.

        Additionally, numerous zoos, like the Jersey Zoo, 
        around the world are breeding captive mountain 
        chickens to ensure that the species doesn't go extinct.
