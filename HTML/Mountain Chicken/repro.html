    <p>
        The mountain chicken’s form of reproduction is 
        highly unusual. Instead of breeding in water, 
        the frog breeds in burrows around 2ft deep, 
        “hence the name <em>giant ditch frog</em>.” 
    </p>
    
    <p>
        The breeding season starts towards the 
        start of the wet season and continues 
        through September. The male will occupy a 
        burrow and emit loud yells to attract a 
        female mate. After breeding, the male defends 
        the burrow while the female lays the eggs. 
        After that, the mountain chicken does something 
        even more unusual. The female lays up to 25,000 
        more unfertilized eggs on which the tadpoles 
        feed on. Eventually, 30 - 40 froglets emerge 
        from the burrow with a lifespan of about 12 years.
