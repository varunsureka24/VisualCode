    <!-- this is the descrption for the physical characteristics -->
    <p>
        The mountain chicken is one of the largest 
        frogs in the world. It can weigh up to 2.2 
        pounds and can reach up to 9 inches in length, 
        although adults generally remain between 6-7 inches.  Female mountain chickens are larger than males. 
    </p>

    <p>
        Mountain chickens are highly colorful. Their 
        underside can vary from being chestnut-brown 
        to plain to even spotted! Their sides can 
        become slightly orange at times, and they have 
        a dark, black line that runs from their snout 
        to the corner of their mouth.
