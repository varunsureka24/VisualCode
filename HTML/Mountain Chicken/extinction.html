    <p>
        Years of habitat loss from deforestation and volcanic 
        eruptions have had the species' population dwindling, 
        and it's only growing worse. In 2002 the deadly chytrid 
        fungus <em>(Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis)</em> arrived in 
        Dominica and devastated the mountain chicken population there.

    <p>Even the leading Mountain Chicken conservation 
        group belived that they were extinct:

    <blockquote cite="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/news/2016/01/160128-mountain-chicken-frog-endangered-animals/" style="font-size: 18px;">
        “At one point they thought mountain chickens were extinct on Dominica,”
         said Jeff Dawson, who is an amphibian program manager at the 
         Durrell Wildlife Conservation Trust.
    </blockquote>

        The fungus then migrated to Monsterrat and by 2009, 
        wiped out more than 80% of the population there. 
        In 2008 there was an estimation of about 8,000 wild 
        mountain chickens, ut by 2019, that number had fallen below 200. 
        Zoos and wildlife conservation groups have attempted to breed 
        mountain chickens in captivity as a last-ditch attempt at 
        preserving the population.
